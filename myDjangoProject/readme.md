The `manage.py` file is a command-line utility in Django projects. It provides various commands to help manage the project, such as running the development server, creating database tables, and running tests. You can execute commands using the following syntax:

```
python manage.py <command>
```

Some commonly used commands include:

- `runserver`: Starts the development server.
- `makemigrations`: Creates new database migration files based on changes in your models.
- `migrate`: Applies pending database migrations.
- `createsuperuser`: Creates a new superuser for the admin interface.
- `test`: Runs the project's test suite.

To see a full list of available commands, you can run `python manage.py help`. Make sure to navigate to the project's root directory before executing any `manage.py` commands.
